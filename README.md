## Description

For our final project for the University of Utah Coding Boot Camp we decided to create a fun but challenging web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). What we came up with was "Stump Me" a trivia game that delivers you challenging trivia questions and never shows you the same question twice in one sitting. In future development this application will have timed questions, an option to find and add friends, compare highscores with your added friends, as well as comment capabilities so that you and your friends can message and trash talk eachother.

## Usage

To use this web application you need to create an account by signing in, or if you already have an account you must login. once you have logged in you will be redirected to the home page where you have the options to either start a new game and get STUMPED or go to your profile page.
